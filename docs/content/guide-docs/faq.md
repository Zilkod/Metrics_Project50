### Why yet another Javascript library?

I'm a lead UI tech engineer at Bank of America, NA,  who deals with many static sites, and see how stuff can sometimes be frustrating for team members when it come to choices. 

So, one week-end afternoon (4/20 weekend 2019 :), while working on a personal project using a static site generator, I thought it was way too much of an overhead to bring in something like Vuejs, React or Angular, just to make a small piece reactive on the personal static site. 

So I decided to create Litedom, to just be a simple drop-in view library that can make any sections of the site reactive without the overhead. I wanted my HTML to stay as is. No React, No Vue, just me and my HTML.

(BTW, See how many days since the last javascript framework:  https://dayssincelastjavascriptframework.com/)

### Who and when would someone use it?

- People who want something simple but still follow the paradigm of the major libraries
- For people working on simple but dynamic static site
- For Blogs site 
- When having React/Vuejs/Angular/(etc) is too much
- When you just want to progressively upgrade your site without changing too much.

### Is it here to replace or does it compete with React, Vuejs etc?

Not at all. **Litedom** is targeting a different set of applications. Most of the time, specially when dealing with static site, you just want a little bit of stuff to be reactive, it could be something from or to an API, it could be something to manage application state or events.

Litedom wants to be your gateway to more advanced frameworks.

It follows the same paradigm as the big ones, just on a smaller scale.
